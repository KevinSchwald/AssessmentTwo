# AssessmentTwo

Given is a csv file containing the gas consumption of a customer. In the file are monthly records of gas consumption.
A record contains the beginning date, the end date, initial counter reading (Begin_indx), final counter reading (End_indx), gas conversion ratio (kpcs).

The consumption per month in m続 is calculated as follows: consumption m続 = End_indx-Begin_indx.

The consumption per month in kWh is calculated as follows: consumption kWh = Round(consumption m続*kpcs).

Tasks:

Calculate the monthly consumption in m続 and in kWh.

Calculate per year: the total consumption, the maximum consumption, the maximum consumption month, the minimum consumption, the minimum consumption month, and the consumption average.

Create a User Interface in the console that prints consumption information about a specific month and/or year.

Write JUnit tests to test the implemented functionality.
